## Idea 💡
It's an idea that comes to my mind for what I can utilize AI for (maybe partially). It's AI for automation, replace redundant and recurring step you absolutely loathe, so you can work on more meaningful tasks!

## Step-by-step thoughts
1/ Find a suitable base model

In mind: DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.3 70B

Main consideration is the model is good at reasoning and comprehending user input, so that it can design what combination of api to call

2/ Power BI Project (.pbip)

My initial thought was to use Power BI api for template generation, but now it seems like a no then. It is too much for api, so I am going to use pbip insetad.

PBIP provides a text editor experience like coding, which is good for being as a template. Copy-paste a template code, then you're good to go!

3/ Training

This part is for me to feed some knowledge, I need to create templates for converting to pbip.

4/ Next steps

After proving this is applicable, I shall move on to replcing some annyoing steps 💢 , like applying conditional foramtting or colours
