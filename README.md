## PowerBI_API
Use Power BI API + AI to quickly create some templates you're going to reuse over and over (though I doubt you would actually need AI for that 🤔)

It's an idea that comes to my mind for what I can utilize AI for (maybe partially). It's AI for automation, replace redundant and recurring step you absolutely loathe, so you can work on more meaningful tasks!

## Step-by-step thoughts
1/ Find a suitable base model

In mind: DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.3 70B

Main consideration is the model is good at reasoning and comprehending user input, so that it can design what combination of api to call

2/ Power BI api

Should check how much capability Power BI api can provide

3/ Training

This part is for me to feed some knowledge, I need to create templates for converting to api calls
